      Q: How much does it cost exactly to stream a track on Resonate?

      A:
      On Resonate, the total cost to purchase and own a track is 1.25 EUR (1.52 USD). However, your payment for that track is paid incrementally each time you listen to it -- split over the first nine times you play that track. We call this model stream2own.

      The first time you play a particular track, the price to play it is extraordinarily inexpensive: 0.0024 EUR (0.0029 USD).

      Each time you return to that track and play it again, the price doubles through the ninth play. That ninth play ends up costing 0.625 EUR (0.76 USD).

      After that ninth play, you have paid 1.25 EUR (1.52 USD) total for the track and are not charged any more to stream it via Resonate after that point. You can stream it as much as you want for free, now that you have fully paid for it.

      The key idea here is that the price per play increases progressively and is based on the particular relationship between a listener and the music they listen to. Plays initially start cheap as you discover a song and then you naturally contribute more toward it as you fall in love with the song.

      Payment is directly linked between each track and each listener. The Resonate Player keeps track of how many times you've listened to each song, and you are automatically charged for each listen according to the system above. As you listen to songs, microcharges are deducted automatically from your credits. You can buy more credits for your account by clicking on the three-dot menu at the upper-right of the Resonate Player.

      There are no subscription fees on Resonate, so you only ever pay for what you play! With each play, 70% of your payment goes to the artist and 30% goes back into the co-operative for development and maintaining the platform. And the co-operative is owned by the artists and listeners themselves!

      In the future, you will also be able to download owned tracks and play them locally -- although that feature is still in development.

      Thank you for your question and for exploring Resonate. If this explanation was unclear, please say so! Thanks for the feedback.
